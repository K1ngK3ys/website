<h4>Music</h4>
<h5>Listening <span>& Producing</span></h5>
<p3>
  I do listen to music in my free time. Especially when coding since it helps me to face each challenge with confidence.
  Besides that I also produce my own music in my free time as well to keep me busy and guess what it is fun... a hell lot of fun.
  I do enjoy listening to relaxing music that is made with a soundboard or music from the 70s/80s.
  My Personal most favorite musician is "INKI-E" who is a really good DJ and obviously makes really good music.
  If you are interested in listening to his music i will link his spotify playlist right here.
